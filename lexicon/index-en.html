  <h2>0. Scope and Nature of the SemanticOps Lexicon v1.0</h2>

  <h3>0.1. Purpose and foundational nature of the Lexicon</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>SemanticOps Lexicon v1.0</strong> is the first official, open and governed
    version of the core terminology of the <em>SemanticOps</em> framework. This version
    gathers the foundational concepts initially proposed by
    <strong>Jorge Luis García</strong>, creator of the framework, and establishes the
    conceptual basis upon which the semantic architecture of SemanticOps will evolve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its purpose is to provide a shared technical language for researchers, engineers,
    organizations, developers and semantic curators, enabling a consistent and operational
    understanding of meaning within the SemanticOps ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lexicon v1.0 is neither definitive nor exhaustive: it is a
    <strong>solid, governed and versioned baseline</strong> designed to be extended
    progressively through formal evolution mechanisms.
  </p>

  <h3>0.2. A living Lexicon sustained by semantic governance</h3>
  <p>
    <em>SemanticOps</em> is grounded in an essential principle:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>“Meaning must be governed, not improvised.”</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    For this reason, the Lexicon is a <strong>living organism</strong>, subject to
    continuous updates under an open, transparent and structured semantic governance
    process. All definitions, relationships and conceptual structures included here are
    subject to controlled review, ensuring coherence, traceability and responsible
    evolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each term includes <em>version, status and last-update date</em> metadata, providing
    full transparency in the evolution of meaning.
  </p>

  <h3>0.3. Community-driven governance model</h3>
  <p>
    The SemanticOps Lexicon adopts a collaborative governance model based on open
    participation, expert review and ethical oversight. The semantic evolution cycle
    follows these stages:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The community proposes</strong>: any member may suggest new concepts or improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Semantic curators evaluate</strong>: experts selected by the community review, validate and refine proposals.</li>
    <li><strong>The governance committee approves or rejects</strong>: a formal process ensures quality, consistency and fidelity to the framework.</li>
    <li><strong>The community implements the update</strong>: approved changes are integrated into the active standard.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This model ensures that the Lexicon evolves within a
    <strong>governed, accountable and traceable ecosystem</strong>, fully aligned with
    the philosophy of <em>SemanticOps</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>0.4. Co-creation of meaning between humans and machines</h3>
  <p>
    <em>SemanticOps</em> acknowledges that knowledge is dynamic and that the evolution of
    meaning is a shared process between humans, AI and the operational context. As
    organizations and cognitive systems evolve, new concepts, redefinitions and natural
    semantic bifurcations emerge.
  </p>
  <p>
    In future versions of the framework, AI systems —including adaptive models and
    semantic agents— will be able to <strong>propose new concepts, detect inconsistencies
    or suggest emerging relationships</strong>, always under the supervision of semantic
    curators and with community approval.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way, <em>SemanticOps</em> establishes a paradigm in which
    <strong>meaning co-creation</strong> is a joint effort between human intelligence and
    artificial intelligence.
  </p>

  <h3>0.5. Base language of Lexicon v1.0</h3>
  <p>
    The official base language of the SemanticOps Lexicon v1.0 is
    <strong>Spanish</strong>, in order to establish a clear conceptual foundation at this
    foundational stage. Future versions (v1.1+) will include an official English edition,
    ensuring semantic equivalence through translation controls and curator review.
  </p>

  <h3>0.6. Final scope statement</h3>
  <p>
    The SemanticOps Lexicon v1.0 is an open standard, publicly versioned and governed by
    a community committed to conceptual quality, coherence and semantic responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its purpose is not to freeze language, but to
    <strong>operate, oversee and expand it</strong> in a technical, ethical and structured
    way, accompanying the convergence between human intelligence and artificial
    intelligence.

<section id="principles" class="lexicon-section">
  <h2>1. Guiding Principles of SemanticOps</h2>
  <p>
    These principles establish the ethical, technical and operational foundation of the
    <strong>SemanticOps</strong> framework. They are not a closed list, but a set of
    fundamentals ensuring that meaning is treated as a critical asset, governed and
    co-created by humans and artificial intelligence under responsible supervision.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Meaning must be governed, not improvised.</strong><br />
      Semantics is managed with method, rigor and responsibility — never by accident.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No concept exists without traceability, version and justification.</strong><br />
      Every term must have history, rationale and evidence for its existence and evolution.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Knowledge is a living organism; its evolution must be explicit, controlled and documented.</strong><br />
      Every semantic change must be recorded and explained.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Humans and AI co-create understanding, but final validation always lies in human judgment.</strong><br />
      AI assists and proposes, but does not legislate meaning without human oversight.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>A concept is not valid if it cannot be understood by both humans and machines.</strong><br />
      SemanticOps demands cognitively interoperable semantics on both sides.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The community is an active guardian of the framework.</strong><br />
      The Lexicon evolves through open and responsible participation.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Semantic curators preserve the coherence of the shared language.</strong><br />
      They evaluate proposals and protect the conceptual integrity of the framework.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Definitions must serve operational understanding, not conceptual ambiguity.</strong><br />
      Each term must provide clarity and help solve real problems.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Every concept must be aligned with its domain, its context and its intent.</strong><br />
      Meaning is never detached from the reality it describes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Explainability is not optional.</strong><br />
      Every decision must be explainable from the semantics that support it.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Semantics should unify, not fragment.</strong><br />
      A shared concept should avoid multiple parallel interpretations without formal justification.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>AI must detect inconsistencies, but never impose definitions.</strong><br />
      Its role is to reveal patterns, not replace human governance.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Every new concept must demonstrate necessity, usefulness and coherence.</strong><br />
      The expansion of the Lexicon must respond to purpose, not fashion.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Semantic evolution must always enhance clarity, never sacrifice it.</strong><br />
      No update should increase ambiguity.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The community should promote, not block, the emergence of new concepts.</strong><br />
      More knowledge implies finer distinctions; finer distinctions enable greater operational precision.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Lexicon is an open standard; its strength comes from its transparency.</strong><br />
      Every debate, change and version must be visible and justifiable before the community.
    </li>
  </ol>
